                        <p>Yerevan University, Department of Philosophy (2023–2028)</p>
                        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> Armenian Higher Education and Science Committee<br>
                        <strong>Role:</strong> Kalle Pihlainen, PI, grant recipient (with Davit Mosinyan, CI, director)</p>
                        <p>This laboratory at the Department of Philosophy, Yerevan University, investigates the problematic of historical knowledge through the lens of theory and philosophy of history, with particular attention to the Armenian context. The initial research focuses on Armenian paradigms of modernization of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, using interdisciplinary methods to examine their relation to questions of memory, identity, and the Armenian genocide and diaspora. The project seeks to develop new theoretical perspectives on how the past is represented. The laboratory team consists of five full-time researchers.</p>

                                <p>The Laboratory for Philosophy and Theory of History is pleased to announce that its first conference is scheduled to take place on 12 and 13 June 2025, hosted by Yerevan State University. The event aims to bring together philosophers and theorists of history, historians, sociologists, as well as other specialists from around the world, and foster the exchange of ideas, questions, and resources. The overarching theme is state-sponsored history. The conference will serve as a platform for examining how states construct, enforce, and challenge historical narratives.</p>

                        <p>This project critically examined contemporary trends in cultural and historical theory. It questioned whether recent dismissals of ‘postmodernism’ and ‘narrativism’ were fully justified, arguing that fundamental theoretical questions from earlier debates remain relevant and unanswered. The research aimed to reframe those core problems from a current perspective. The project was based at the Departments of Philosophy and Cultural Theory at Tallinn University.</p>

                        <p>Funded by a long-term JSPS Invitation Fellowship, this project engaged with pressing issues in the theory and philosophy of history following the linguistic turn. Building on exchanges with Japanese colleagues, the research explored alternatives to traditional representational approaches by focusing on materiality, presence, and experience. Hosted at Waseda University, the project involved research and seminars there and at Toyo University.</p>

It brought together 12 members, connecting researchers from the Department of Teacher Education at the University of Turku, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Oulu, and the Department of Philosophy at Åbo Akademi University. Members contributed through academic publications, workshops, and conferences, collaborating to explore the nature and formation of historical expertise.</p>

                        <p>This project sought to address a perceived deadlock in debates surrounding historical representation; namely, the persistent opposition between narrative construction and the possibility of historical truth. Based at the Department of Philosophy at Åbo Akademi University, the research examined how historical understanding is shaped through embodied experience, ethical responsibility, and the interpretive role of the reader. The goal was to clarify how these dimensions could inform more reflective and responsible approaches to writing history today.</p>

                        <p>This project explored representational challenges in historical writing through a close study of Jean-Paul Sartre’s biographical writing. Drawing on narrative and performance theory, it examined the tension between conveying historical understanding and achieving narrative empathy. The research also considered how Sartre’s experimental style complicates conventional distinctions between historical interpretation and literary form. The research was conducted at the Department of Cultural History, University of Turku.</p>
